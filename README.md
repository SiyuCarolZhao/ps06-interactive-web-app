The dataset we will be using is the basic information on NFL players and their statistics. We found this dataset on Kaggle. There are three groups of data (basic stats, career stats, and game logs). This data was collected by the National Football League . However, this data was last updated 6 years ago, according to Kaggle, so there will likely be some out-of-date information.

The second tabpage is the plot of weigths and heights of footabll athletes. Users can choose the color, the number of observations, and the positions of players. If the request number of observations is smaller than what the dataset has, then it will only show the number of observations it has.

The third tabpage is the table of each athelet's information. Users can choose the size of observations and the positions of players.
